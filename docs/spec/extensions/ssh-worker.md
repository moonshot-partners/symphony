# SSH Worker Extension (OPTIONAL)

This document describes a common extension profile in which Symphony keeps one central orchestrator but executes worker runs on one or more remote hosts over SSH. It is an extension to the [Symphony Service Specification](../../../SPEC.md) and is not REQUIRED for conformance.

## Extension Config

- `worker.ssh_hosts` (list of SSH host strings, OPTIONAL)
  - When omitted, work runs locally.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` (positive integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Shared per-host cap applied across configured SSH hosts.

## 1. Execution Model

- The orchestrator remains the single source of truth for polling, claims, retries, and reconciliation.
- `worker.ssh_hosts` provides the candidate SSH destinations for remote execution.
- Each worker run is assigned to one host at a time, and that host becomes part of the run's effective execution identity along with the issue workspace.
- `workspace.root` is interpreted on the remote host, not on the orchestrator host.
- The coding-agent app-server is launched over SSH stdio instead of as a local subprocess, so the orchestrator still owns the session lifecycle even though commands execute remotely.
- Continuation turns inside one worker lifetime SHOULD stay on the same host and workspace.
- A remote host SHOULD satisfy the same basic contract as a local worker environment: reachable shell, writable workspace root, coding-agent executable, and any required auth or repository prerequisites.

## 2. Scheduling Notes

- SSH hosts MAY be treated as a pool for dispatch.
- Implementations MAY prefer the previously used host on retries when that host is still available.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is an OPTIONAL shared per-host cap across configured SSH hosts.
- When all SSH hosts are at capacity, dispatch SHOULD wait rather than silently falling back to a different execution mode.
- Implementations MAY fail over to another host when the original host is unavailable before work has meaningfully started.
- Once a run has already produced side effects, a transparent rerun on another host SHOULD be treated as a new attempt, not as invisible failover.

## 3. Problems to Consider

- Remote environment drift:
  - Each host needs the expected shell environment, coding-agent executable, auth, and repository prerequisites.
- Workspace locality:
  - Workspaces are usually host-local, so moving an issue to a different host is typically a cold restart unless shared storage exists.
- Path and command safety:
  - Remote path resolution, shell quoting, and workspace-boundary checks matter more once execution crosses a machine boundary.
- Startup and failover semantics:
  - Implementations SHOULD distinguish host-connectivity/startup failures from in-workspace agent failures so the same ticket is not accidentally re-executed on multiple hosts.
- Host health and saturation:
  - A dead or overloaded host SHOULD reduce available capacity, not cause duplicate execution or an accidental fallback to local work.
- Cleanup and observability:
  - Operators need to know which host owns a run, where its workspace lives, and whether cleanup happened on the right machine.
